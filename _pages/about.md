I am Zhiqiang Luo, currently an undergraduate student in Automation at Tsinghua University. My research interests are about integrating physical information into 3D Vision models, and my recent research focuses on 3D shape optimization. 

I used to be advised by Prof. Yebin Liu about predicting simulation results using deep learning frameworks. I'm admitted to UT Austin's Ph.D. program and will be advised by Prof. Qixing Huang and Prof. Etienne Vouga.
